# 🌸 FestMap

**FestMap** is a lightweight, open-source, AI-powered Streamlit app that collects and preserves information about Indian festivals from diverse communities. It enables users to contribute details in their local languages, helping build a culturally rich, multilingual dataset for training inclusive AI models.
